# dotfiles #

## Overview ##

Default configuration files for my user environment.

## Introduction ##

Over the years, every sysadmin (and software developer, user, etc.)
learns / creates / borrows bunches of
little tweaks and hacks for their dotfiles: `.profile` and `.bashrc`
and so on and so forth. Then there are other little tweaks and hacks
in little scripts that are very useful to have around.

Then, you log in to a new machine, or you change jobs, or have some
change in environment, and now you don't have them any more. Of
course, you can just make a copy of .profile to the new machine, but
oh, crap ... your base machine is OS/X and you need them for Linux
... or, you've installed some package on your base machine that
twiddled your .profile and didn't do it nicely, etc.

So, this repository will contain "generic" startup dotfiles for
various tools that I use. They will be sanitized [hopefully] to avoid
revealing any personal information that should not be in GitHub. Maybe
they will be useful to other sysadmins as well.

## How To Use This Repository ##

Doing a search of [GitHub](github.com), I find 67,561 repositories,
some that include refined installation scripts and other tools. I'm

or broken, drop me a line.
