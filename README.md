# dotfiles #

## Overview ##

Default configuration files for my user environment.

## Introduction ##

Over the years, every sysadmin (and software developer, user, etc.)
learns / creates / borrows bunches of
little tweaks and hacks for their dotfiles: `.profile` and `.bashrc`
and so on and so forth. Then there are other little tweaks and hacks
in little scripts that are very useful to have around.

Then, you log in to a new machine, or you change jobs, or have some
change in environment, and now you don't have them any more. Of
course, you can just make a copy of .profile to the new machine, but
oh, crap ... your base machine is OS/X and you need them for Linux
... or, you've installed some package on your base machine that
twiddled your .profile and didn't do it nicely, etc.

So, this repository will contain "generic" startup dotfiles for
various tools that I use. They will be sanitized [hopefully] to avoid
revealing any personal information that should not be in GitHub. Maybe
they will be useful to other sysadmins as well.

## How To Use This Repository ##

Doing a search for "dotfiles" on [GitHub](https://github.com), I find
67,561 repositories, some that include refined installation scripts
and other tools. 

Eventually, this might turn into a beautifully
crafted, elegant set of template files that embodies a convention to
include local modifications or augmentations, etc. I'm not there
yet. Right now I am just trying to tidy up my own mess.

Feel free to browse, clone, fork,
copy what you find useful. No warranty, bla bla bla ... if you find
something is useful, or broken, drop me a line: [rbj@spotch.com]
