## Overview ##

    Elisp libraries that I frequently use.

## Note ##

    This is not a canonical repository for these libraries. These
    are here to facilitate loading them locally to my
    workstations. You should obtain these from the canonical source
    locations.

    My .emacs.el expects to find them in ${HOME}/.emacs.d/lisp/ if
    they have not been installed as system files.
