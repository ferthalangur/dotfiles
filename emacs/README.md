## Overview ##

Configuration files libraries for Emacs

## Installation ##

Everything in this directory should be copied into a folder named
_.emacs.d_ in your home directory. Most of the configuration is found in
init.el ... which is referred to in most of my other README files as
.emacs.el because that is where it used to live.

Useful information about configuring this in
[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html]

## Contents ##

`init.el` : The Emacs initialization file

`lisp/` : Any Elisp libraries required by the init file

`legacy/` : Snippets for various functionality, acquired cruft over the
years ... all obsolete now probably.
