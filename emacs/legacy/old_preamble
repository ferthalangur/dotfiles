;;; This stuff was from the beginning of my .emacs.el forever
;;; ... mostly fixed problems by now.

;;;	The following are a security feature that should
;;; be included by default in everyone's .emacs!
;;;
;;;;(setq inhibit-local-variables t)
;;;;(setq enable-local-variables nil)
;;; I believe it is a security hole to remove the next line:
;;;;(put 'eval-expression 'disabled nil)
;;; Despite RMS's misgivings, set-input-mode seeems :-) to fix the flow-
;;;control problem on the ISN.  Who knows what else it might break!
;;;Of course, it leaves us without a Control-Q key for quote, but
;;; CTRL-S seems to work!
;;;(set-input-mode nil t nil)
;;;(global-unset-key "\C-s")
;;;(global-unset-key "\C-x\C-s")
